# Automated Parking Space Detection System

## üöó Project Overview

The **Automated Parking Space Detection System** uses **Computer Vision** techniques to detect available and occupied parking spots in real-time. This project aims to make parking management more efficient and reduce the time spent searching for available spots.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time parking space monitoring** using video feeds.
- **Automatic detection** of available and occupied parking spaces.
- **Mouse-based manual input** to define parking spot positions.
- **Color-coded visual feedback** for easy identification of available (green) and occupied (red) spots.
- **Real-time statistics** of empty parking spaces displayed on the feed.
